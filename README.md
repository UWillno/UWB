UWillno's blog/browser

它只是一个Android Webview的套壳，我想玩某个网站但默认浏览器的交互不太合适，于是乱写了这个，顺便测试了下我的wasm博客的功能。对于我要玩的内容已经足够了，对于我的博客还是存在问题，比如我还不知道如何处理`window.showSaveFilePicker`，虽然我知道webview 132之后是支持的，目前就这样吧。

It's just a Android Webview. I want to play with a certain website, but the interaction of the default browser is not very suitable, so I wrote this a random thing and tested the functionality of my wasm blog. It's enough for what I want to play, and there are still problems with my blog, such as I don't know how to deal with `window.showSaveFilePicker`, although I know webview 132 is supported later, so that's it for now.
